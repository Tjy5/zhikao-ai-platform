# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered public examination platform (Êô∫ËÄÉÂÖ¨ËÄÉ‰º¥‰æ£) that provides intelligent essay grading for Chinese civil service exam preparation. The system consists of:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwindcss v4
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.10+, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic
- **Architecture**: Microservices with containerized deployment using Docker

## Development Commands

### üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended)

#### Full Stack Development (One Command)
```powershell
# Start both frontend and backend with dynamic port allocation
.\dev-fullstack.ps1

# Features:
# - Automatic port conflict resolution
# - Real-time service status monitoring  
# - Displays actual service URLs
# - Safe shutdown with Ctrl+C
# - Won't interfere with other applications
```

#### Development Management Scripts
```bash
# Quick operations and status checks
quick-restart.bat status       # Check service status
quick-restart.bat start        # Start both services
quick-restart.bat restart      # Restart services
quick-restart.bat stop         # Quick stop
quick-restart.bat safe-stop    # Safe stop with confirmation

# Features:
# - Dynamic port support (reads from backend_port.txt/frontend_port.txt)
# - Precise process termination (no accidental kills)
# - Service status monitoring
# - Safe confirmation prompts
```

### Frontend (Next.js)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install                    # Install dependencies
npm run dev                   # Start development server with turbopack (dynamic port)
npm run build                 # Build for production with turbopack  
npm run start                 # Start production server
npm run lint                  # Run ESLint
```

### Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
cd backend
# One-click development (recommended) - handles venv, deps, DB, migrations
.\dev.ps1                     # Windows PowerShell (auto-setup + dynamic port)

# Manual development setup
python -m venv .venv          # Create virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Activate venv (Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install dependencies
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001 # Start development server
pytest                       # Run all tests
pytest -v                    # Run tests with verbose output
pytest tests/test_specific.py # Run specific test file
```

### Database
```bash
cd backend
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description" # Generate migration
alembic upgrade head          # Apply migrations
```

### Docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d db      # Start PostgreSQL database (detached)
docker-compose up            # Start all services
```

### Database Connection
- **Host**: localhost:5432
- **Database**: mydb
- **Username**: myuser
- **Password**: mypassword

## Architecture

### Backend Structure
- `app/main.py` - FastAPI application entry point with CORS and global exception handling
- `app/api/endpoints/` - API route handlers
- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic models for request/response validation
- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy database models
- `app/services/` - Business logic and AI service integration
  - `ai_service.py` - OpenAI integration for essay grading
  - `prompt_service.py` - Prompt template management
  - `desc_enrich.py` - Description enrichment service
  - `desc_compose.py` - Description composition service
- `app/db/` - Database configuration and connection management
- `app/core/` - Core configuration and utilities
- `alembic/` - Database migration files
- `dev.ps1` / `dev.sh` - One-click development setup scripts

### Frontend Structure
- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main essay grading interface
- Uses client-side form handling for essay submission
- Integrates with backend API at `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/`
- Runs on `http://localhost:3000` in development

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Next.js dev server with dynamic port allocation (starts from port 3000)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with dynamic port allocation (starts from port 8001) 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on port 5432 (via Docker)
- **Port Management**: 
  - Services automatically find free ports if defaults are occupied
  - Port information saved to `backend_port.txt` and `frontend_port.txt`
  - Scripts read actual ports from these files for accurate operations
- **One-click setup**: `dev-fullstack.ps1` handles complete environment setup

### Key Features
- **Essay Grading**: AI-powered analysis of Chinese civil service exam essays
- **Question Types**: Supports Ê¶ÇÊã¨È¢ò, ÁªºÂêàÂàÜÊûêÈ¢ò, ÂØπÁ≠ñÈ¢ò, Â∫îÁî®ÊñáÂÜô‰ΩúÈ¢ò
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides scoring, detailed feedback, and improvement suggestions
- **Responsive UI**: Modern interface built with Tailwind CSS

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/essays/grade` - Submit essay for AI grading
- `GET /api/v1/essays/ai-status` - Check AI service status
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Development Notes

- Backend uses automatic API documentation via FastAPI (available at `http://localhost:8001/docs`)
- Frontend uses Next.js App Router with TypeScript
- Database migrations managed through Alembic
- AI essay grading service integrates with OpenAI API
- CORS is configured to allow all origins for development
- Global exception handling provides detailed error information
- Project includes Chinese documentation in markdown files

### Development Workflow

#### üåü Recommended: One-Click Full Stack Development
1. **Start Everything**: Run `.\dev-fullstack.ps1`
   - Automatically starts backend (with venv, deps, DB, migrations)
   - Automatically starts frontend with turbopack
   - Finds free ports if defaults are occupied
   - Displays actual service URLs when ready
   - Monitors service health continuously

#### Alternative: Individual Service Management  
1. **Backend**: Use `.\dev.ps1` in `backend/` directory for complete auto-setup
   - Automatically creates Python virtual environment
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Starts PostgreSQL via Docker Compose
   - Applies database migrations
   - Starts FastAPI server with hot reload on available port
2. **Frontend**: Use `npm run dev` in `frontend/` directory for Next.js development
   - Automatically finds available port starting from 3000
   - Updates API configuration to match backend port
3. **Database**: Managed automatically by backend dev script or manually via `docker-compose up -d db`

#### üõ†Ô∏è Development Operations
- **Status Check**: `quick-restart.bat status` - See all running services
- **Quick Restart**: `quick-restart.bat restart` - Restart both services  
- **Safe Shutdown**: `quick-restart.bat safe-stop` - Stop with confirmation
- **Port Conflicts**: All scripts automatically handle port conflicts

### Testing
- Backend tests can be run with `pytest` from the `backend/` directory
- Use `pytest -v` for verbose test output
- Run specific tests with `pytest tests/test_filename.py`
- Multiple test files exist for various components and integration testing

### Utility Tools
- `tools/safe_cleanup.py` - Safely move unwanted files to .trash folder based on cleanup_candidates.txt
- `tools/restore_from_trash.py` - Restore files from .trash folder  
- Backend generates log files: `backend.log`, `backend_new.log`

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
