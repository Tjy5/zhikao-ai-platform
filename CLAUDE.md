### AI Service Implementation Details

#### Question Type Recognition (`ai_service.py`)
- **Dual Recognition**: Combines AI-based recognition with heuristic fallback for reliability
- **Operator Precedence Fix**: Corrected logic bug that caused comprehensive analysis questions to be misidentified as summary questions
- **Enhanced Keywords**: Expanded keyword detection for comprehensive analysis questions (ÂàÜÊûê, ÁêÜËß£, Ë∞àË∞à, ËØÑ‰ª∑, ËØ¥Êòé, Â¶Ç‰Ωï, ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πà, ÂÖ≥Á≥ª, ‰ΩúÁî®, ÊÑè‰πâ, ÂΩ±Âìç, ÂéüÂõ†)
- **Multi-layer Requirements**: Detects complex question patterns requiring both explanation and analysis

#### Reasoning Model Support
- **Content Field Handling**: Processes both `content` and `reasoning_content` response fields
- **Token Management**: Increased limits to accommodate reasoning model response patterns
- **Answer Extraction**: Implements `extract_answer_from_reasoning()` for parsing reasoning model outputs

#### Content Filtering System
- **Prompt Leakage Prevention**: Removes internal AI instructions from user-facing content using regex patterns
- **Multiple Pattern Detection**: Handles various forms of prompt instruction leakage
- **User-friendly Output**: Ensures clean, professional interface without exposing AI internal prompts
- **Suggestion Optimization**: Replaces generic suggestions with specific, actionable feedback when available

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
